  <p class=MsoNormal>@file posh.h</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>@author Brian Hook</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>Header file for POSH, the Portable Open Source Harness
  project.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>NOTE: Unlike most header files, this one is designed to be
  included</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>multiple times, which is why it does not have the
  @#ifndef/@#define</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>preamble.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>POSH relies on environment specified preprocessor symbols
  in order</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>to infer as much as possible about the target
  OS/architecture and</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>the host compiler capabilities.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>NOTE: POSH is simple and focused. It attempts to provide
  basic</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>functionality and information, but it does NOT attempt to
  emulate</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>missing functionality.  I am also not willing to make POSH
  dirty</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>and hackish to support truly ancient and/or outmoded
  and/or bizarre</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>technologies such as non-ANSI compilers, systems with
  non-IEEE</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>floating point formats, segmented 16-bit operating
  systems, etc.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>Please refer to the accompanying HTML documentation or
  visit</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>http://www.poshlib.org for more information on how to use
  POSH.</p>
